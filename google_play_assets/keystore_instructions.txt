INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENERATING A KEYSTORE FOR ANDROID APP SIGNING

To generate a keystore for signing your Android app, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

keytool -genkey -v -keystore democrac.keystore -alias democrac_key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

2. You will be prompted to:
   - Enter a password for the keystore
   - Enter your name, organization, city, state, and country
   - Confirm the information
   - Enter a password for the key (you can use the same as the keystore password)

3. After generating the keystore, move it to the android directory:

mv democrac.keystore /path/to/your/project/android/

4. Update the signing.properties file with the passwords you used:

KEYSTORE_FILE=democrac.keystore
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password
KEY_ALIAS=democrac_key
KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password

IMPORTANT: Keep this keystore file safe! If you lose it, you won't be able to update your app on Google Play in the future.

NOTE: You need to use the same keystore for all future updates of your app. If you lose your keystore, you'll need to publish a new app with a different package name.
